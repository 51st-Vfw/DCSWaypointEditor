# DCS Waypoint Editor

DCS Waypoint Editor (DCSWE) is an application that allows you to input waypoints
(including airframe-specific waypoints such as the MSN preplanned missions waypoints in
the F/A-18C Hornet) and other data, such as avionics configurations, into DCS aircraft.
This functions as a simple DTC while ED works on an official DTC for DCS.

> **NOTE**: DCSWE likely becomes a historical curiosity once official DTC support is
> available from ED. Until that point, DCSWE can serve as a simple DTC.

Currently DCSWE supports the following airframes,

* A-10C Warthog
* AV-8B Harrier
* F-14A/B Tomcat
* F-16C Viper
* F/A-18C Hornet
