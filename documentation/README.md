# DCS Waypoint Editor

> DCS Waypoint Editor is no longer being actively supported or developed as we are moving our
> time and effort to 
> [JAFDTC](https://github.com/51st-Vfw/JAFDTC).
> We encourage you to consider transitioning to that DTC.

> It's been a good run, hopefully you found it useful.

DCS Waypoint Editor (DCSWE) is an application that allows you to input waypoints
(including airframe-specific waypoints such as the MSN preplanned missions waypoints in
the F/A-18C Hornet) and other data, such as avionics configurations, into DCS aircraft.
This functions as a simple DTC while ED works on an official DTC for DCS.

> **NOTE**: DCSWE likely becomes a historical curiosity once official DTC support is
> available from ED. Until that point, DCSWE can serve as a simple DTC.

Currently DCSWE supports the following airframes,

* A-10C Warthog
* AV-8B Harrier
* F-14A/B Tomcat
* F-16C Viper
* F/A-18C Hornet
* M-2000C Mirage

> **NOTE**: Not all features are supported on all airframes.

The documentation is broken up into several core chapters.

* [Installation & Setup](https://github.com/51st-Vfw/DCSWaypointEditor/blob/master/documentation/Installation.md):
  How to install and setup of DCSWE.
* [Preferences](https://github.com/51st-Vfw/DCSWaypointEditor/blob/master/documentation/Preferences.md):
  Describes the function of each DCSWE preferences
* [Waypoint Setup](https://github.com/51st-Vfw/DCSWaypointEditor/blob/master/documentation/Waypoint_Setup.md):
  Outlines the use of the waypoint setup functionality.
* [Avionics Setup](https://github.com/51st-Vfw/DCSWaypointEditor/blob/master/documentation/Avionics_Setup.md):
  Outlines the use of the avionics setup functionality.
* [DCSWE & DCS](https://github.com/51st-Vfw/DCSWaypointEditor/blob/master/documentation/DCSWE_DCS.md):
  Discusses how DCSWE and DCS interact to set up a jet or retrieve F10 map
  coordinates for a waypoint.

In addition, the following chapters cover less used functionality in the program,

* [CombatFlite Integration](https://github.com/51st-Vfw/DCSWaypointEditor/blob/master/documentation/CF_Integration.md):
  Describes how to integrate DCSWE with CombatFlite.
* [Mission Packages](https://github.com/51st-Vfw/DCSWaypointEditor/blob/master/documentation/Mission_Packs.md):
  Describes how to build mission packages for use by DCSWE.
