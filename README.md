# Hornet Waypoint Editor

Simple configurable script to input preplanned missions and waypoints coordinates into the DCS F/A-18C.

This script works by emulating keyboard presses - it has no "sense" of what pages are currently displayed on your aircraft.

For this reason, before executing the script, make sure your HSI is on your AMPCD (bottom screen) and the stores page is on the left DDI.

**While the script is executing, make sure not to minimize DCS - remember it's only pressing keys for you.**
